# Uconn Planetarium Shows

## I host back ups of HTML scripts to run planetarium shows here! 

All were written for UConn's digitarium, running Nightshade G3 and StratoScript. 
They are intended to be used in the Lesson tab of the planetarium software. No images or videos are included, since mary are proprietary. Please contact Kelcey Davis via email at kelcey.davis33@gmail.com for questions or help setting up shows.
