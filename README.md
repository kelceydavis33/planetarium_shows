# Uconn Planetarium Shows

## I host back ups of HTML scripts to run planetarium shows here! 

All were written for UConn's digitarium, running Nightshade G3 and StratoScript. All here were scripted by me (Kelcey) but are frequently given by various planetarium presenters at UConn.
They are intended to be used in the Lesson tab of the planetarium software. No images or videos are included, since mary are proprietary. Please contact Kelcey Davis via email at kelcey.davis33@gmail.com for questions or help setting up shows.

**galaxy_show**: A short (~15 minute) show giving a tour through the dust, stars, and suppermassice black hole our galaxy hosts. Begins with an asside on astrology to make sense of looking at constellations normally up during the day, and then Sagitarius, which hosts Sag A* (suppermassive black hole).

**research_showcase**: A longer (~30 minute) talk on the research hapening at UConn Astrophysics. None of the visuals are included (proprietary). Starts with a nearby look at planet formation in the milky way, then the milky way itsself, then nearby star forming galaxies, large galaxy surveys, and finally high resolution numerical simulations.
