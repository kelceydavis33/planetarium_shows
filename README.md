# Uconn Planetarium Shows

## I host back ups of HTML scripts to run planetarium shows here! 

All were written for UConn's digitarium, running Nightshade G3 and StratoScript. All here were scripted by me (Kelcey) but are frequently given by various planetarium presenters at UConn.
They are intended to be used in the Lesson tab of the planetarium software. No images or videos are included, since mary are proprietary. Please contact Kelcey Davis via email at kelcey.davis33@gmail.com for questions or help setting up shows.

## Contained Shows:

**galaxy_show**: A short (~15 minute) show giving a tour through the dust, stars, and suppermassice black hole our galaxy hosts. Begins with an asside on astrology to make sense of looking at constellations normally up during the day, and then Sagitarius, which hosts Sag A* (suppermassive black hole).

**research_showcase**: A longer (~30 minute) talk on the research hapening at UConn Astrophysics. None of the visuals are included (proprietary). Starts with a nearby look at planet formation in the milky way, then the milky way itsself, then nearby star forming galaxies, large galaxy surveys, and finally high resolution numerical simulations.

**aliens**: A long (~30 minute) show about aliens! We got through the planets in out solar system, making the calse for life on each. We then detail the efforts of astronomers to send messages out into the cosmos and end with a visualization of all known planets and use deep field images to give a scale for the number of galaxies.

**eclipse**: A short ~20 minute show on total solar and lunar eclipses, focusing on those visible this year over Storrs, CT

**kids**: 15-25 minute super generic kids show covering the types of bright things in the sky
