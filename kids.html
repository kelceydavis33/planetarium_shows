    <div class="narration">Lots of stuff. Most of the bright points in our night sky are stars! Stars are other suns, most with their own orbiting planets! We divide up the bright stars in our night sky by their location in constelations.</div>

    <div class="narration">One of these constellations is Ursa Major.</div>
    <div class="narration">Story: Zeus cheat on wife, zeus turn  lover in to bear to hide her from Hera, son of Zeuse's lover becomes hunter, comes across mother as bear and draws bow, Zeus turns son in to bear so he does not kill his mother, alerting Hera, Hera tries to kill bears, Zeus grabs them by their tails, spins them around, then laucnhes them in to sky</div>
    <div class="narration">You might be more farmiliar with a part of Ursa Major, the big dipper! The big dipper isn't actually a constellation. It's what we call an asterism, a commonly recognized pattern in the sky but not as big as a constellation. In fact, the''big dipper" name has origins in the US. Southern African American slaves drank water from hollowed gords and called the big dipper the "Drinking Gord in the Sky", which always pointed North to freedom. Over time, drinking gord in the sky became big dipper, and today we call it the big dipper</div>
    <div class="effect" data-transport="false" data-type="command" data-value="select constellation UMI">Toggle Ursa Minor</div>
    <div class="narration">Follow the handle of the big dipper and you'll find Ursa Minor, the little bear, which hosts the north star! If you're lost and you can find this star, it will always point you North.</div>

    <div class="narration">Taurus the bull constellation is up. The bull in the sky is such an old constellation, we struggle to date it! The Greeks saw a bull, but Taurus dates back to at least the Bronze age. There is even a paitning in the Hall of Bulls in France which appears to depict a bull next to a cluster of stars that appears similar to the pliedes. An ancient depiction of the Taurus constelation? That's what some archeologists argue!</div>
